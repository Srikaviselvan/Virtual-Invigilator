# Virtual Invigilator
The Virtual Invigilator project aims to provide a solution for remote proctoring during online examinations by monitoring and restricting certain activities to prevent malpractices.

# Files:
browser_monitor.py: This script allows only certain browsers to be opened in a tab, ensuring that students cannot switch to unauthorized browsers during the examination.
chat_application_monitor.py: Restricts the usage of specific chat applications to prevent communication between students during the examination, thus minimizing the chances of cheating.
eye_tracker.py: Tracks the movement of the user's eyes, detecting whether they are focusing on the monitor or looking away. This helps in ensuring that the student's attention remains on the examination screen.
mouse_monitor.py: Monitors the movement of the mouse, detecting if it goes outside the examination tab or engages in suspicious activity, providing an additional layer of vigilance against cheating.
tab_restriction.py: Restricts the opening of additional tabs during the examination, preventing students from accessing unauthorized resources.
Virtual_Invigilator.py: This script merges all the aforementioned operations to create the Virtual Invigilator, providing comprehensive monitoring and restriction functionalities during online examinations.

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that Python is installed on your system.


# Note:
This project is designed to enhance the integrity of online examinations by monitoring and restricting certain activities. However, it is not foolproof and may have limitations. It is recommended to use additional measures and human invigilation for effective proctoring.
Customize the settings and restrictions according to your institution's guidelines and requirements.
For any issues or suggestions, please feel free to contact the project maintainers.
